Starting my journey in 2018 during university and began with <b>pure JavaScript</b> and <b>jQuery</b> while working as a trainee.<br/> Later, during my 3 years at Basalam, I worked with various technologies, including <b>React (class-based components)</b>, <b>jQuery</b>, <b>Laravel</b>, and eventually <b>Vue</b> and <b>Nuxt.js</b>, which became my primary stack at the time.<br /> Over 2 years ago, I've decided to focus on learning and building numerous projects using <b>React</b> and <b>Next.js</b> and <b>Typescript</b> which have now become my main stack. This experience has helped me refine my skills in modern front-end development and application architecture.  "
